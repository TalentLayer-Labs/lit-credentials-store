This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun install && bun run dev
```

ps: bun is needed because yarn, pnpm and npm generates an error with the contracts-sdk package.
